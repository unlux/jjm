This is just a sample file to indicate that product images would normally be stored in this directory. 

In a production environment, you would have actual product images here with the following file names:
- dino-color-match.jpg
- wooden-mosaic.jpg
- balancing-rabbit.jpg
- wooden-beads.jpg
- stacking-tray.jpg
- russian-blocks.jpg
- nut-truck.jpg
- bead-count.jpg

Since we don't have these specific images in the repository, we're using existing images from the public directory as placeholders in our PopularProducts component.
